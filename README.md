Basic agent based model showcase

  This is a simple expample of an agent based model, created in C++ Builder, that tries to simulate behavior of the bees searching for the food.
  
  These are basic principles of the simulation:
  1. Bee goes out from the beehive
  2. Bee picks a random flower from the grassland
  3. Then it tries to get as close to the flower as possible while momentum and trying to be in constant motion
  4. When it gets close enough, it carries honey to the beehive

Thee is also rule when enough honey is gathered, the new bee emerges from the beehive.

Those simple rules show how overshooting and acceleration causes movemnt to be more organic and beliveable even in such a basic model.
